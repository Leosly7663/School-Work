# C Projects Overview

## 1. Protein FASTA Linked List

### Description:
The Protein FASTA Linked List project implements a linked list data structure in C to efficiently store protein sequences from FASTA files. It provides functionalities for retrieval and sorting of protein data.

### Features:

#### a. Linked List Implementation
- Efficiently stores protein sequences using a linked list.
- Dynamic memory allocation for flexibility.

#### b. FASTA File Handling
- Parses and reads protein information from FASTA files.
- Supports retrieval of specific protein data.

#### c. Sorting Mechanism
- Implements sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort) for efficient organization.
- Allows users to retrieve sorted protein data.

#### d. Memory Management
- Ensures proper memory management to avoid memory leaks.

## 2. Trie Structure for Information Organization

### Description:
The Trie Structure project in C focuses on implementing a Trie data structure to organize and store information from either an input file or a web database. This structure enables efficient searching and retrieval of stored data.

### Features:

#### a. Trie Implementation
- Efficiently organizes and stores information using a Trie.
- Supports quick search operations.

#### b. Input Source Flexibility
- Accepts input from both files and web databases.
- Handles data in a structured Trie format.

#### c. Searching and Retrieval
- Provides efficient mechanisms for searching and retrieving stored information.
- Optimized Trie traversal for performance.

#### d. Memory Optimization
- Implements memory-efficient Trie nodes.
- Minimizes memory consumption for large datasets.
