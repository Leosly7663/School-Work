Generally I think that my soultion is well implemented I am aware of memory leaks present in the program
I would like to go back and fix these but i did not expect these issues to be so time consuming and did
not properly allocate my time to allow for enough time to fix them
I am not sure if the head only method is actually supposed to take that long to go through the files if not 
there may be a memory issue to look over there, i found that by keeping a tail pointer and being able to 
instantly append that the time and efficiency was so much faster. I learned a great bit about the power of a
well organized data structure


Below are all the resources I used while putting this program together
